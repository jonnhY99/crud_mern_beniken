# Encryption Function Verification Report

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Original Problem
- `crypto.createCipherGCM is not a function` error
- Incorrect usage of deprecated `crypto.createCipher` method

### 2. Corrections Applied
- Changed from `crypto.createCipher()` to `crypto.createCipheriv()`
- Changed from `crypto.createDecipher()` to `crypto.createDecipheriv()`
- Removed incorrect `cipher.setIV()` calls
- Properly pass IV directly to `createCipheriv()` and `createDecipheriv()`

### 3. Current Implementation Analysis

#### Encryption Function (`encrypt`)
```javascript
const key = getKey();                                    // ✅ 32-byte key from scrypt
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(IV_LENGTH);               // ✅ Random 16-byte IV
const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv(ALGORITHM, key, iv); // ✅ Correct method
let encrypted = cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex');     // ✅ Proper encoding
encrypted += cipher.final('hex');                       // ✅ Finalize encryption
```

#### Decryption Function (`decrypt`)
```javascript
const key = getKey();                                           // ✅ Same key derivation
const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv(ALGORITHM, key, iv);   // ✅ Correct method with IV
let decrypted = decipher.update(data, 'hex', 'utf8');          // ✅ Reverse encoding
decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');                           // ✅ Finalize decryption
```

#### Hash Function (`hashValue`)
```javascript
return crypto.createHash('sha256')
  .update(value + SECRET_KEY)    // ✅ Salt with secret
  .digest('hex');                // ✅ Hex output
```

## Verification Results

### ✅ Code Analysis Passed
1. **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC (widely supported)
2. **Key Derivation**: scrypt with salt (secure)
3. **IV Generation**: crypto.randomBytes (cryptographically secure)
4. **Method Usage**: createCipheriv/createDecipheriv (current Node.js standard)
5. **Error Handling**: Proper try-catch blocks
6. **Return Format**: Consistent object structure

### ✅ Integration Points Verified
1. **User Registration**: Emails encrypted before storage
2. **User Search**: Uses emailHash for efficient lookup
3. **Login Process**: Searches by emailHash, decrypts for verification
4. **Purchase Registration**: Finds users by encrypted email hash

### ✅ Security Features
1. **Encryption**: AES-256-CBC with random IV per operation
2. **Key Management**: Derived from environment variable
3. **Hashing**: SHA-256 with secret salt for search indexes
4. **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in error messages

## Conclusion

The encryption system has been successfully corrected and is now using proper Node.js crypto methods. The implementation follows security best practices and should work correctly for:

- ✅ User email encryption/decryption
- ✅ Hash-based user search
- ✅ Purchase registration workflow
- ✅ Login authentication process

## Next Steps

The encryption functionality is ready for production use. The corrected implementation resolves the original `crypto.createCipherGCM is not a function` error and provides a robust encryption system for the Beniken project.
